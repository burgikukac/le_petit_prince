# DS od Unstructured Text Data homeworks + final project 

My final project can be found in the **final_project** directory. The **store** folder is also part of the final project, it stores downloaded gutenberg files as a cache. I will delete them after the evaluation.

*'Le_petit_prince'* is an analysis on different language versions of the popular 'Le petit prince'. 

The idea is to see the differences between the languages and the (available) sentiment lexicons.

There is a second analyis, *Dickens vs. Twain* that shows some interesting aspects of the letters written by these authors. 


Both works are **homework 2** for the course  **DS of Unstructured Text Data** held by *Eduardo Ari√±o de la Rubia* on CEU in 2018.

Now there is a third file, **topic_modeling** which is a basic analysis for the third homework.
