#  02 Gutenberg download
# 
#  This script downloads tons of books from the Gutenberg project (more than 500!)
#  and saves each as a feather file. 
#  However, if the target file already exists, the download only happens with FORCED_OVERWRITE = TRUE
#
#  Actually no need to run until the list of desired books unchanged - the analyis will
#  use the available final_tidy file
#  
#
#  Input: download_this.feather (+raw text files from Project Gutenberg)
#  Output: separate .feather files in the ./store folder   
# 

library(gutenbergr)
library(feather)

  file_name <- paste0("./store/", as.character(actual),".feather")
  if ((FORCED_OVERWRITE == TRUE) || !file.exists(file_name)) {
    downloaded <- gutenberg_download(actual)
