# le_petit_prince

This is an analysis on different language versions of the popular 'Le petit prince'. 

The idea is to see the differences between the languages and the (available) sentiment lexicons.

There is a second analyis, Dickens vs. Twain that shows some interesting aspects of the letters written by these authors. 


Both works are **homework 2** for the course  **DS of Unstructured Text Data** held by *Eduardo Ari√±o de la Rubia* on CEU in 2018.

Now there is a third file, **topic_modeling** which is a basic analysis for the third homework.
